# Day 1 - Band Name Generator 

The following topics were covered in Day 1:
- `print()`, `input()`, `len()` functions
- strings, integers, and floats
- Creating and storing information in variables

Today's project:
- Creating a simple band name generator using user input.
- See Band-Name-Generator.py

Notes to self:
- remember to include spaces (`" "`) within the strings so that the print output has readable structure
